## 🚀 Deployment to Railway

### Prerequisites
1. Create a [Railway](https://railway.app) account
2. Install Railway CLI (optional but recommended)

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. **Prepare Your Code**
```bash
# Clone/download this repository
cd lagos-bright-futures

# Install dependencies
npm run install-all
```

#### 2. **Deploy to Railway**

**Option A: Using Railway Dashboard (Recommended for beginners)**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo" (or "Deploy from local")
4. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the project

**Option B: Using Railway CLI**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

#### 3. **Add PostgreSQL Database**

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click "New"
2. Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create a database and provide a `DATABASE_URL`

#### 4. **Set Environment Variables**

In Railway dashboard, go to your service → Variables tab, add:

```env
DATABASE_URL=[Auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL]
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

#### 5. **Initialize Database Schema**

After deployment, you need to run the database schema:

**Option A: Using Railway CLI**
```bash
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < server/schema.sql
```

**Option B: Using Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to your PostgreSQL database in Railway
2. Click "Connect" → Copy the connection string
3. Use a PostgreSQL client (like pgAdmin or DBeaver) to connect
4. Run the `server/schema.sql` script

#### 6. **Build and Deploy**

Railway will automatically:
- Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- Build the frontend (`npm run build`)
- Start the server (`npm start`)

Your app will be live at: `https://your-project.railway.app`

### 🔐 Default Admin Login

After deployment, you can login with:
- **Email:** `admin@lagosbrightfutures.org`
- **Password:** `admin123`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Change this password immediately after first login!

## 📱 Local Development

# Edit .env with your local database credentials
```

### 3. Setup Database
```bash
# Create PostgreSQL database
createdb lagos_bright_futures

# Run schema
psql lagos_bright_futures < server/schema.sql
